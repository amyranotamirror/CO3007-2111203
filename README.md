## Introduction
Teacher: Huynh Phuc Nghi
Student: Nguyen Thanh Hien

This is a repository to track my progress while learning the experimental lab of CO3009 in the first semester, 2023 - 2024. 
- Requirements: can be retrieved via branch _**requirement**_
- Report: can be retrieved via branch _**report**_
- Exercise for each Lab can be retrieved via: _**Labx/Exercise_y**_ (with **x**: the lab index, **y**: exercise index)

## Indexing

> Even though this particular method of organizing files can be weird, it's more convenient for my teachers to grade the lab.
